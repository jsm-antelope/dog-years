"# dog-years" 

//this has been written in javascript, and is a really basic calculator to compare human vs dog years.

//this is my age
let myAge = 35;

//define the value of earlyYears, this is expected to change
let earlyYears = 2;

//this is multiplying the value of early years by 10.5
earlyYears *= 10.5;

//subtracting 2 from myAge and putting the result into a new variable called laterYears, and then multiplying this by 4
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
laterYears *= 4;

//this takes my age and converts it to dog years 
myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;

//storing my name in the variable called myName, and converting all letters to lower case
myName = 'James'.toLowerCase();

//creating a sentence using temlate literals etc. This states my age and what it would be in dog years
sentence = `My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`

console.log(sentence);
